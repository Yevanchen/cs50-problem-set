# Week 0: Scratch Project

## Project Description

This is a simple Scratch project that implements a basic game. The main features include:

1. Multiple sprites controlling paddles
2. A bouncing ball
3. A basket for scoring
4. A scoring system

## Game Mechanics

- The ball bounces off the paddles when hit
- When the ball enters the basket, points are scored
- The game demonstrates basic principles of game design and interactivity in Scratch

## Learning Objectives

This project helps to understand:
- Sprite control and interaction
- Basic game physics (ball bouncing)
- Simple scoring mechanisms
- Event handling in Scratch

## How to Play

1. Use the paddles to hit the ball
2. Try to guide the ball into the basket
3. Score as many points as possible

This project serves as an introduction to programming concepts using Scratch's visual programming environment.
